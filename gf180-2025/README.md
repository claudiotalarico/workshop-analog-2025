`techsweep_nfet_03v3.sch` - techology sweep for the nfet_03v3 device - the data from the sweep is saved in techsweep_nfet_03v3.txt<br>
`techsweep_pfet_03v3.sch` - techology sweep for the pfet_03v3 device - the data from the sweep is saved in techsweep_nfet_03v3.txt<br>
`techsweep_txt_to_mat.ipynb` - notebook to convert the data from .txt format to .mat format (pygmid needs the data in .mat format)<br>
`techsweep_plots_from_mat.ipynb` - notebook to plot the LUT's FOMs in graphical form<br>
`test_lut.py` - simple example showing how to access the LUTs' data using **pygmid**

More info on how to use **pygmid** is available at the [pygmid repo](https://github.com/dreoilin/pygmid)

#### NOTE: 
There is no need to run the techsweeps and generate the .txt and .mat files.<br>
The files `nfet_03v3.mat` and `pfet_03v3.mat` can be downloaded directly at:<br>
